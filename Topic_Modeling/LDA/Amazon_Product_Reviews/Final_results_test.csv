302,302,2.0,0.6093000173568726,"tv, fire, amazon, echo, music, alexa, work, device, product, app",despite less than friendly price point if you dont get it on sale this amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description the emphasis with this item is show so its no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the echo but if you want the convenience of voice controlled screen other than your phone this product delivers its value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams another added bonus comes when friends or family also have show so that you can do drop in which is essentially visual phone calls its great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy
303,303,2.0,0.9760000109672546,"tv, fire, amazon, echo, music, alexa, work, device, product, app",previously had echo dots in play at my home so knew wanted more from my alexa echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream too very cool looking forward to alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics hands free is the way to go
304,304,2.0,0.5680999755859375,"tv, fire, amazon, echo, music, alexa, work, device, product, app",the alexa show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the show is good device it is lacking in some aspects that had in the older device im not sure if im missing it in the show but was able to get internet cameras on the older device such as san diego zoo elephants that you cant get on the show while certainly not deal breaker it was fun to watch setup was pretty straight forward and easy it is good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to certain extent it is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want such as play or start or open use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then more or other combination you would have to set up several different alarms one for each day as far as can see some of the alarm sound choices are bit alarming dont really want to be terrified awake each day found one that was mellow and at moderate sound level works well it would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what youd like dont see that yet anywhere another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off if you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times id rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with swipe which is possible but very sensitive and if you miss here comes snooze just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with particular anomaly am thinking of getting thermostat that hooks to it so can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time hoping that works well when it arrives it will be nice to raise the temp degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed all in all id say its good emerging technology but needs little work considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago its kind of where were heading
305,305,2.0,0.8127999901771545,"tv, fire, amazon, echo, music, alexa, work, device, product, app",alexa show is really well put together the main reason for my purchase was to create my own surveillance system linking my ring doorbell and ring floodlights to view on command by alexa on the show screen yes you can talk to it and get results for almost any query but with the show you get lot more the touch screen is great for video calls especially when you install the alexa app on your family cell phones alexa can scan items via upc and order them on amazon or tell you where to get them the recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you but shown to you also when music plays you can see the lyrics on screen if you use amazon music to play the music you can ask for news briefing and you see the news highlights etc the speakers arent quite up to the same standard as the echo series but its close the sound fills the room nicely when the echo show is not being immediately used the screen shows picture of your choice making it digital frame too overall the device is very nice and they are constantly releasing new skills for alexa to use so it seems like there is always something new to wow you turning on and off lights adjusting your thermostat playing music viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties there is way more to do with this device

2364,2364,1.0,0.5716999769210815,"kindle, read, book, screen, light, fire, reader, paperwhite, device, amazon",ive had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tablet first while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system dont feel like im using android this feels different to me it doesnt have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine its simply fun way to consume your magazines books etc there are on screen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when dont need it on screen but its open the button to the right is super important it took me couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them youll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps the device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps pre installed such as slik amazons own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesnt necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however believe it only changes the font on your main screens if you have magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with free month subscription to the washington post youll see that under new items when you initially activate your tablet you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazons photos app which is cloud based app so far havent found way to effectively use different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper im not crazy about the amazon photo app found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazons cloud just so could view them on my tablet that being said im not planning to take photos on this device just wanted few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper beyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are pre arranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books youve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesnt seem to be way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but its not the end of the world theres also one menu to the left of the home menu its the recent page it shows you what youve received looked at on the tablet never use it but it might be handy for some people one of my favorite features of this tablet is amazons on deck capability if youre an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download video to your device that it thinks you might like the items dont count against your pre installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you dont like it ive been content with the video playback capability this isnt my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok ill talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand ive tried magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now can always have my magazines with me so if im stuck at the airport or at the doctors office always have them one of my regular magazines includes free digital version of the magazine for free just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as ive had an account my other magazine didnt include digital edition so canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for days on the device did this with third magazine and decided to keep it for year viewing magazines on this gadget is pleasure the kindle fire doesnt come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this its not difficult to do if youre fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me minutes most of the apps wanted were in the amazon store but there were handful that had paid for through google play the only way could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far despise the keyboard that amazon pre installed on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but hate it fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading new keyboard it was pretty easy problem to solve so cant complain apps that are connecting to the internet can be little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesnt bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isnt bad if compare it to my fancy phone its not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstanding the speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen wont say that they are fantastic they arent in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it little better by downloading different music app instead of relying on the pre install app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to bluetooth speaker use pair of headphones etc this device wasnt made for taking pictures it has front and back camera but they arent designed to be spectacular im not using them find this device little difficult to hold in my hands think thats partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives im still waiting for it im greatly enjoying this device its simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you dont typically use amazon and you are just looking for tablet for viewing the internet and youre looking for low price tag this device may be ok for you

amazon fire so want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tablet first while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system dont feel like im using android this feels different to me it doesnt have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine its simply fun way to consume your magazines books etc there are on screen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when dont need it on screen but its open the button to the right is super important it took me couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them youll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps the device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps pre installed such as slik amazons own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesnt necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however believe it only changes the font on your main screens if you have magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with free month subscription to the washington post youll see that under new items when you initially activate your tablet you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazons photos app which is cloud based app so far havent found way to effectively use different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper im not crazy about the amazon photo app found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazons cloud just so could view them on my tablet that being said im not planning to take photos on this device just wanted few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper beyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are pre arranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books youve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesnt seem to be way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but its not the end of the world theres also one menu to the left of the home menu its the recent page it shows you what youve received looked at on the tablet never use it but it might be handy for some people one of my favorite features of this tablet is amazons on deck capability if youre an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download video to your device that it thinks you might like the items dont count against your pre installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you dont like it ive been content with the video playback capability this isnt my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok ill talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand ive tried magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now can always have my magazines with me so if im stuck at the airport or at the doctors office always have them one of my regular magazines includes free digital version of the magazine for free just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as ive had an account my other magazine didnt include digital edition so canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for days on the device did this with third magazine and decided to keep it for year viewing magazines on this gadget is pleasure the kindle fire doesnt come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this its not difficult to do if youre fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me minutes most of the apps wanted were in the amazon store but there were handful that had paid for through google play the only way could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far despise the keyboard that amazon pre installed on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but hate it fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading new keyboard it was pretty easy problem to solve so cant complain apps that are connecting to the internet can be little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesnt bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isnt bad if compare it to my fancy phone its not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstanding the speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen wont say that they are fantastic they arent in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it little better by downloading different music app instead of relying on the pre install app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to bluetooth speaker use pair of headphones etc this device wasnt made for taking pictures it has front and back camera but they arent designed to be spectacular im not using them find this device little difficult to hold in my hands think thats partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives im still waiting for it im greatly enjoying this device its simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you dont typically use amazon and you are just looking for tablet for viewing the internet and youre looking for low price tag this device may be ok for you
